Hoffman\n\n\n\nPhysics PhD Candidate studying glueballs at GlueX\n\nI'm currently a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying the strong force through the GlueX collaboration. GlueX is a multinational collaboration located in Hall D at Jefferson Lab which collides high-energy photons with a proton target.\nThe main goal of GlueX is a search for particles with exotic quark content. Standard composite particles are identified in two main categories, mesons (made of a quark-antiquark pair) and baryons (three quarks). However, there has been recent experimental evidence of states with more than three quarks, dubbed tetraquarks, pentaquarks, etc. Computer simulations (Lattice QCD) predict additional states such as glueballs, which contain no quarks at all and are just bound states of the \"gluons\" that hold matter together, and hybrid mesons, where a valence gluon contributes to the total angular momentum to produce \"forbidden\" quantum numbers.\nMy thesis work consists of a study of $K_SK_S$ (pairs of K-short mesons) photoproduction. This gives us access to even-spin $f$ and $a$ mesons (light, flavorless particles with isospin $I_3 = 0$ and $1$ respectively), the former of which are interesting for several reasons. First, they share many of the same quantum numbers, the values we use to classify particles, with glueballs, hypothetical particles that contain only gluons, the force-carrier of the strong interaction. The lightest of these glueballs is predicted to look nearly identical to some of the $f_0$ mesons (spin-$0$ $f$ mesons), and it turns out that there are too many of these $f_0$ mesons seen in experiments for them to all be compatible with the quark model.\nHowever, the downside of this particular study is that there are lots of other particles present in the $K_SK_S$ channel, and many of them overlap each other. Hopefully my work at GlueX can provide a small step in disentangling this complex set of states and move us closer to understanding the complex physics of quantum chromodynamics.\nLinks\n\nEmail: dene at cmu dot edu dot saola (my email doesn't really end with a spindlehorn)\nORCID\nGoogle Scholar\nGitHub\n\n","id":"https://denehoffman.com/","title":""},"https://denehoffman.com/blog/":{"body":"\nA blog that's maybe about music and maybe about physics (but not about string theory)\n\n","id":"https://denehoffman.com/blog/","title":"String Theory"},"https://denehoffman.com/blog/the-bfgs-algorithm-family-in-rust-part-1/":{"body":"The BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm and its derivatives were (and for the most part still are) the gold standard methods for quasi-Newton optimization. In this post, I want to give a brief overview of the main idea, the limited-memory adaptation (L-BFGS), and the bounded version (L-BFGS-B) and how I implemented them in a Rust crate I'm developing called ganesh. The full algorithm can be seen there, and I will mainly be focusing on the main methodology, since the actual literature on it is rather old and difficult to parse (and even has a few typos!).\nThat being said, I wouldn't have done it without the following articles/projects which have guided my understanding:\n\n\"Numerical Optimization\" by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright\n\"Numerical Optimization: Understanding L-BFGS\" by Aria Haghighi\nL-BFGS-B in pure Python by @avieira (Alex Vieira?)\nL-BFGS-B in pure MATLAB by Brian Granzow\n\"A Limited Memory Algorithm for Bound Constrained Optimization\" by Richard H. Byrd, Peihuang Lu, Jorge Nocedal, and Ciyou Zhu\n\nQuasi-Newton?\nTypically, in numeric optimization problems, we want to define some stepping process that will cause us to approach a minimum or maximum as quickly as possible. For our purposes, we'll just assume we only care about minimizing, and we'll also assume that there is a single global minimum to the function in question, or at least that we don't care about falling into a deep local minimum. The simplest non-trivial way to do this is by gradient descent:\n$$\n\\vec{x}_{k+1} = \\vec{x}_k - \\alpha_k \\vec{\\nabla} f(\\vec{x}_k)\n$$\nwhere $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the objective function we are trying to minimize and $\\alpha_n$ is some positive step length (also called the learning rate). The minus sign here is why we call it gradient descent; we are always moving opposite the gradient, which always points uphill. For simplicity, we'll also refer to the gradient as a function $\\vec{g}(\\vec{x}) \\equiv \\vec{\\nabla}f(\\vec{x})$ Now if you just throw in some very small value for $\\alpha$ and cross your fingers, you might eventually end up at the function's minimum, but it certainly won't be the most efficient way to get there. If your $\\alpha$ is too big, you could end up overshooting the minimum and bouncing back and forth around it endlessly.\nThere are several ways we can optimize the choice of step length. Skip ahead to here to see the implementation I use for the BFGS family.\nRust implementation\nFunction trait\nLet's start by defining a trait which will evaluate our function $f$ and its gradient $\\vec{g}$. I want the input parameter values $\\vec{x}$ to be generic so that both f64 and f32 types can be used, as well as any other struct with the right trait implementations. I also want these functions to return Results with a generic error type E so that users can handle any errors their own functions create. Finally, we should consider adding optional arguments to these functions. Again, we will turn to generics, but allow users to pass a &amp;mut U called user_data. This term is mutable because it will give us the most flexibility later on. The trait for a function might look something like this:\n\nI also use a little macro to convert raw numeric fields to our generic type T, if possible:\n\nLet's walk through the anatomy of the trait above. I think the evaluate method is pretty self-explanatory (given that it's an empty template), but the gradient method is a bit more complex. First of all, I'm implementing a central finite-difference here:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f(\\vec{x})}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{f(\\vec{x} + h_i \\hat{e}_i) - f(\\vec{x} - h_i \\hat{e}_i)}{2h_i}\n$$\nThe tricky detail is choosing a value for $h_i$. In practice, machine epsilon is too small! What we actually should use is $h_i = \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon} x_i $ when $x_i \\neq 0$ and $h_i = \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon}$ in the event that $x_i = 0$.\nAlgorithm Trait\nNext, since we want to implement three algorithms with very similar features, it might make sense to create a generic trait that can be used by some executor that will wrap all of these methods into a nice API. All of these algorithms will will need to know the following:\n\nThe objective Function\nThe starting point $x_0$\nAny bounds on the free parameters (we will ignore bounds for the BFGS and L-BFGS methods here, although an experimental change of variables is implemented in the final crate)\nThe user_data to pass to the Function\n\nWe should also define what an algorithm should give us in return!\n\nThe best position at the end of the minimization, $x_\\text{best}$\nThe function value at that point, $f(x_\\text{best})$\nThe number of function/gradient evaluations\nSome indication as to whether the result of the minimization is valid\nSome String message that can tell us any additional information about how the fit progressed/is progressing\n\nLet's call this struct Status and define it as follows:\n\nNote that we have set this up in a way that doesn't let any algorithm decrement the number of function/gradient evaluations. Additionally, no outside function can un-converge a converged Status. We will also typically update $f(x_\\text{best})$ every time we update $x_\\text{best}$, so there's only one way to do this to ensure they don't get out of sync for any reason.\nNext, the Algorithm trait itself:\n\nMost of these methods are fairly self-explanatory and have very similar signatures. Finally, let's wrap all of this up in a nice interface for the end-user to work with:\n\nFor now, we will ignore the Bound struct mentioned here, since we won't use it till we get to the L-BFGS-B algorithm. Note that PhantomData is required here because we don't actually store anything of type U or E but we need to include it in generics.\nThe main minimize function should also look pretty straightforward. We first call Algorithm::initialize and then proceed into a while-loop that checks if we either exceed the maximum allowed algorithm steps or if Algorithm::check_for_termination tells us to stop the algorithm (in case of problems or convergence). Inside this loop, we just run Algorithm::step. We finish off with Algorithm::postprocessing and grab the final Status of the algorithm. This will be the workflow for every Algorithm we implement1.\nLine Searches\nWe will be implementing an algorithm that attempts to satisfy the Strong Wolfe conditions. These are conditions for accepting a step length given some step direction $\\vec{p}$ (we'll see later why we need to generalize this, but for now you can always just imagine $\\vec{p} = -g(\\vec{x})$).\nThe first of these conditions is also called the Armijo rule:\n$$\nf(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_k \\vec{p}) \\leq f(\\vec{x}) + c_1 \\alpha_k \\left(\\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{g}(\\vec{x})\\right)\n$$\nfor some value $0 &lt; c_1 &lt; 1$. The usual choice of $c_1$ is $10^{-4}$, which I believe just comes from some experimentation on standard test functions. This method is also called the sufficient decrease condition, and we can see why. The left-hand side is the function value at the new location, which we hope is at least smaller than the previous location (otherwise we are ascending!). However, for it to be sufficiently smaller, the difference must exceed the final term in the equation, which is usually going to be negative due to that dot product.\nThe second condition, dubbed the curvature condition, requires that the gradient of the function decrease sufficiently. This is usually harder to accomplish, so when we implement this in Rust, we will make it optional but desired.\n$$\n-\\left(\\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{g}(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_k \\vec{p})\\right) \\leq -c_2 \\left(\\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{g}(\\vec{x})\\right)\n$$\nThis condition adds another hyperparameter, $0 &lt; c_1 &lt; c_2 &lt; 1$ where $c_2 = 0.9$ in most applications. However, if we really want to find the best point, we should try to satisfy the strong version of the curvature condition:\n$$\n\\left|\\vec{p}_k \\cdot \\vec{g}(\\vec{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\vec{p}_k)\\right| \\leq c_2 \\left|\\vec{p}_k \\cdot \\vec{g}(\\vec{x}_k)\\right|\n$$\nWe'll start the implementation with another trait (since other algorithms might use a different search method):\n\nWe'll be implementing Algorithms 3.5 and 3.6 from \"Numerical Optimization\", which (roughly) reads as follows:\nAlgorithm 3.5\n\n$\\alpha_0 \\gets 0$, $\\alpha_\\text{max} &gt; 0$, $\\alpha_1 \\in (0, \\alpha_\\text{max})$, $i \\gets 1$\nloop\n\n\nif\n$f(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_i \\vec{p}) &gt; f(\\vec{x}) + c_1\\alpha_i\\left(\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x})\\right)$ (not Armijo)\nor\n($i &gt; 1$ and $f(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_i \\vec{p}) \\geq f(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_{i-1}\\vec{p})$) (the function value has not decreased since the previous step)\nthen return $\\text{zoom}(\\alpha_{i-1}, \\alpha_i)$\n\n\nif\n$\\left|\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_i\\vec{p})\\right| &lt; c_2 \\left|\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x})\\right|$ (strong Wolfe)\nthen return $\\alpha_i$\n\n\nif\n$\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_i\\vec{p}) \\geq 0$ (gradient at new position generally points in the same direction as the given step direction)\nthen return $\\text{zoom}(\\alpha_i,\\alpha_{i-1})$\n\n\n$\\alpha_{i+1} \\in (\\alpha_i, \\alpha_\\text{max})$ (choose some larger step that is smaller than the max step)\n\n\n$i \\gets i + 1$\n\n\n\n\nIn each loop, we are first checking to see if the function is sufficiently decreasing. If it isn't, we know that the step size overshoots. Imagine we are just minimizing into a 1D parabola. If we are sitting to the left of the minimum, the optimal step length $\\alpha_\\text{opt}$ would put us right at the minimum. If we pick a step $\\alpha &lt; \\alpha_\\text{opt}$ would be fine, but it would mean we converge slower than optimal. The same can be said for a step length $\\alpha &gt; \\alpha_\\text{opt}$, but at a certain point, we will be stepping to a point higher up the parabola than where we began, even though we are moving in the right direction! Step 2.1 ensures that if this happens, we will do a more refined search (zoom) between the current and previous step lengths (note that $\\alpha_{i-1} = 0$ when $i=1$ on the first loop). This will happen a lot if we pick a starting step length that is too large (see the following diagram).\n\nIf we are decreasing, we are in that region where we are converging, but we might not be converging at an optimal rate. This is where the strong Wolfe condition comes in. We first project the gradients at the original and stepped positions onto the step direction. If the gradient is the step direction (well, opposite to it), then we can ignore $\\vec{p}$ here and think of this in terms of a change in gradient magnitude. If the gradient decreases by at least a factor of $c_2$, we accept the step (see the following diagram).\n\nIf we are decreasing sufficiently, but the magnitude of the projected gradient isn't (the gray region in the previous plots), we are either undershooting the optimal step, in which case we should increase the step size and run the loop again (Step 4) or we are overshooting, in which case we should run zoom between the current step and the previous one. How do we tell? Well, if we overshoot, the gradient on the next step will tell us to move in the opposite direction, but if we undershoot, we should still be moving in the same direction. This is what the if-statement of Step 3. checks for.\n\nIn the above plot, both points meet the Armijo condition, but they fail to meet the strong Wolfe condition. This means they make it to Step 3 in our line search algorithm. For the left-most point, the gradient points in the $-x$ direction while the step was in the $+x$ direction, so the condition at Step 3 is not satisfied, and we increase our step size (hopefully landing in the green region). For the right-most point, the gradient now points in the $+x$ direction, so Step 3 is satisfied and we again zoom between this step size and the previous. Note that the arguments to zoom are switched here. In the definition of the zoom algorithm, we will refer to the first argument as $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$ and the second as $\\alpha_{\\text{hi}}$. However, since $\\alpha_i$ is strictly increasing in Algorithm 3.5, we shouldn't think of one of these values as larger than the other, but rather that the function evaluations at these points are lower or higher. Here, $\\alpha_\\text{lo}$ will always refer to a step length which satisfied the Armijo condition, which means that the function value with this step length is the lower of the two. $\\alpha_\\text{hi}$ will be the previous step if the current one is the first to satisfy the Armijo condition (Step 2.3) or it will be the current step if the previous step gave a smaller function evaluation (Step 2.1). In either case, we know that the optimal step length is in the given range.\nAlgorithm 3.6 (zoom)\n\nloop\n\n\nChoose $\\alpha_j$ between $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{hi}}$ (it's possible for $\\alpha_\\text{lo} &gt; \\alpha_\\text{hi}$).\n\n\nif\n$f(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_j \\vec{p}) &gt; f(\\vec{x}) + c_1\\alpha_j\\left(\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x})\\right)$ (not Armijo)\nor\n$f(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_j \\vec{p}) \\geq f(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_{\\text{lo}}\\vec{p})$ (the function value has not decreased relative to $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$)\nthen $\\alpha_\\text{hi} \\gets \\alpha_j$\nelse\n\n\nif\n$\\left|\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_j\\vec{p})\\right| \\leq c_2\\left|\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x})\\right|$\nthen return $\\alpha_j$\n\n\nif\n$\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{g}(\\vec{x} + \\alpha_j\\vec{p}) (\\alpha_\\text{hi} - \\alpha_\\text{lo}) \\geq 0$\nthen $\\alpha_\\text{hi} \\gets \\alpha_\\text{lo}$\n\n\n$\\alpha_\\text{lo} \\gets \\alpha_j$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are only a few possible outcomes of this loop. The \"middle\" outcome is to return $\\alpha_j$ if it satisfies the Strong Wolfe and Armijo conditions. We check first for Armijo (remember, this is generally less restrictive), and if it's not satisfied, or if the evaluation is worse than $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$, we move $\\alpha_{\\text{hi}}$ to $\\alpha_j$. Remember, the subscripts represent the relative value of the function evaluated at that step, and we know that Algorithm 3.5 will guarantee that the two steps given will surround the \"green\" region of optimal step size. If Armijo is satisfied but Wolfe is not, we will always move $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$ up to $\\alpha_j$, but if the condition in 2.2 is met, this implies that either the order of $\\alpha_{\\text{hi}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$ is opposite what we think it should be (because in reality these functions are not always smooth minima like the previous diagrams) or the step $\\alpha_j$ no longer goes in the direction of steepest descent. In either case, we then need move our $\\alpha_{\\text{hi}}$ endpoint to $\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}$ first. I'd recommend drawing out several minima scenarios to get a handle on this algorithm, but eventually it will start to make some sense.\nTogether, these algorithms constitute a line search which should result in a step that satisfies Strong Wolfe curvature conditions. This is needed to get optimal convergence from BFGS-like algorithms, but in practice it's not always efficient to run either algorithm in a (possibly infinite) loop, so I add a maximum number of loops to both algorithms. From my own testing, most problems will have no issue converging within a maximum of 100 iterations for each algorithm. That being said, here's my implementation of the line search:\n\nThe full implementation (with a nicer API and some other features I'm not going to mention in these blog posts) can be found here. In the next post, I will describe the first of the BFGS family of algorithms, the standard BFGS algorithm (no bounds, no limited-memory optimizations).\n1\nIn the full code, there are additional clauses for updating outside Observers, which can monitor the Algorithm at each step.\n\n","id":"https://denehoffman.com/blog/the-bfgs-algorithm-family-in-rust-part-1/","title":"The BFGS Algorithm Family in Rust (Part 1)"},"https://denehoffman.com/blog/the-bfgs-algorithm-family-in-rust-part-2/":{"body":"\nSince writing the previous post, I have made several simplifications to the library that will change how some structs and traits are used here. The biggest change is that I've abandoned generic floats in favor of a feature gate:\n\nWith this code, I can turn the f32 version of my crate on and off with a feature flag. While generics can be nice, in this instance they were actually causing the crate to be slower (just according to some of my own internal benchmarks, this might not be the case in general) and more difficult to read. Any instances in the last post where there was a generic type T representing floating-point values have been replaced with this Float type, so Status&lt;T&gt; is now just Status, for example.\n\nLet's talk about the core BFGS algorithm. The details I'm using here can be found in Nocedal and Wright's book \"Numerical Optimization\" in Chapter 6: Quasi-Newton Methods. In the last post, I alluded to this and described gradient descent, but we should really cover what Newton's method is first.\nNewton's Method\nThe core idea of gradient descent was that we get the gradient at the initial point and walk downhill. We can couple this with a line search to figure out the optimal step size to take downhill, but that's about the best we can do with a single derivative. With two derivatives, however, we can do just a bit better (converge faster). First, let's Taylor expand our function around some point $x$:\n$$ f(x + t) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(x)t^2 $$\nWe can imagine this as a function of just $t$, keeping $x$ fixed, and try to figure out the value of $t$ that minimizes the function. This can be done by realizing that the derivative of $f(x + t)$ with respect to $t$ should be zero at extrema and the second derivative should be positive at a minimum:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}t} \\left(f(x) + f'(x)t  \\frac{1}{2} f''(x)t^2 \\right) = f'(x) + f''(x)t $$\nor $t = -\\frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)}$.\nIn more than one dimension $n$, we write $f'(x) \\to \\vec{\\nabla}f(\\vec{x})$ (a $n$-dimensional vector) and $f''(x) \\to \\nabla^2 f(\\vec{x}) = H$. This second derivative term is an $n \\times n$ matrix called the Hessian, and the matrix equivalent of the reciprocal here is the matrix inverse. The Hessian is just a matrix of second derivatives, $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\vec{x})}{\\partial \\vec{x}_i \\partial \\vec{x}_j}$, so it is symmetric by definition.\nThe Hessian is also positive definite, which just means that for all nonzero vectors $\\vec{q}$,\n$$\\vec{q}^{\\intercal} H \\vec{q} &gt; 0$$\nWith all of this in mind, recall that the gradient descent update step was\n$$ \\vec{x}_{k+1} = \\vec{x}_k - \\alpha_k \\vec{\\nabla} f(\\vec{x}_k) $$\nso the equivalent second-derivative (Newton) update step is\n$$ \\vec{x}_{k+1} = \\vec{x}_k - \\alpha_k H_k^{-1} \\vec{\\nabla} f(\\vec{x}_k) $$\nAs far as I know, this is the optimal second-order method for numeric optimization (in theory). In practice, it tends to be horribly inefficient to compute a Hessian matrix and subsequently invert it, and this problem gets worse when you increase the number of free parameters. Particularly, we rarely know the analytic first and second derivatives of our objective function (and it could be argued that knowing those would often make optimization trivial). In most cases, we would have to do these derivatives numerically:\n\nI'm not sure if I've written this function as efficiently as possible, but already we can see the issue. To accurately calculate the Hessian, we need to take the gradient in two places for each free parameter (g_plus and g_minus), a process which requires at least two function calls for each free parameter. That's a total of $4n^2$ function evaluations for $n$ free parameters. If the function takes one second to evaluate and has ten free parameters, the gradient will take twenty seconds, but the Hessian will take over six minutes. Now it might seem silly to speculate on a function which takes a full second to evaluate (at that point, we can expect any optimization problem is going to take a while), but the real issue is scaling. If we add a single free parameter to this problem, it now takes eight minutes. Most of the problems I deal with in my research can be evaluated in less than 200ms, but they contain over 40 free parameters. Do the math, that's 21 minutes for a single evaluation of the Hessian, and we have to do that at every step in the optimization!\nFortunately, there's a better, faster way. Rather than calculating the full Hessian, let's just approximate it! After all, in the limit of very small steps, the Hessian shouldn't be changing that much (for nice functions), so it makes sense that there should be some way to approximate the next Hessian given the current (and the gradients at both points). This is what puts the \"quasi\" in quasi-Newton methods. We outline some way of approximating the current Hessian given some history of past Hessian approximates and gradients and apply Newton's method for optimization.\nLet's refer to this approximate Hessian as $B_k$1. Furthermore, following the derivation in Nocedal and Wright, let's write the second-order Taylor expansion of our function at the point $\\vec{x}_k$. I'll use $f_k \\equiv f(\\vec{x}_k)$ to represent the objective function and $\\vec{g}_k \\equiv \\vec{\\nabla}f(\\vec{x}_k)$ to represent the gradient.\n$$\nm_k(\\vec{p}) = f_k + \\vec{g}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{p}^{\\intercal} B_k \\vec{p}\n$$\nThis approximation is identical to our function when $\\vec{p} = 0$, and furthermore, the gradient is also the same. The only difference is in the second derivatives, which are approximately the same. We can assume that we'll use some line search to find the optimal step length $\\alpha_k$ to get to the new point, $\\vec{x}_{k+1} = \\vec{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\vec{p}_k$. Let's go to this next point and write out the Taylor expansion for the next step here:\n$$\nm_{k+1}(\\vec{p}) = f_{k+1} + \\vec{g}_{k+1}^{\\intercal} \\vec{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{p}^{\\intercal} B_{k+1} \\vec{p}\n$$\nNow imagine we took this step and looked back at the old position and calculated the gradient using this new expansion evaluated at the old position. We would hope to get the same result as when we used our old expansion! We can actually make this a constraint on our matrix $B$. To look back at the old position, we evaluate the function at $p = -\\alpha_k\\vec{p}_k$, since this is the step we just took but reversed in direction. We can then write the gradient as\n$$\n\\vec{\\nabla} m_{k+1}(-\\alpha_k\\vec{p}_k) = \\vec{g}_{k+1} - \\alpha_k B_{k+1} \\vec{p}_k\n$$\nand with the requirement that $ \\vec{\\nabla} m_{k+1}(-\\alpha_k\\vec{p}_k) = \\vec{g}_k $, we get a new rule for our approximate Hessian:\n$$\nB_{k+1}\\alpha_k\\vec{p}_k = \\vec{g}_{k+1} - \\vec{g}_k\n$$\nThere is some conventional notation to this that we will use throughout the derivation. Rather than using each individual gradient and position, it is helpful to just think about the change in gradient and position, or\n$$ \\vec{s}_k = \\vec{x}_{k+1} - \\vec{x}_k = \\alpha_k\\vec{p}_k $$\nand\n$$ \\vec{y}_k = \\vec{g}_{k+1} - \\vec{g}_k $$\nIn this notation, the gradient requirement (called the secant equation), is as follows:\n$$ B_{k+1}\\vec{s}_k = \\vec{y}_k $$\nRemember when we said the Hessian is positive definite? We would like our Hessian approximate to be positive definite too. Since we don't include any zero-length jumps, $|\\vec{s}_k| &gt; 0$, so we can multiply the previous equation by another $\\vec{s}_k$ to find:\n$$ \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} B_{k+1} \\vec{s}_k &gt; 0 \\implies \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{y}_k &gt; 0 $$\nThis requirement on $\\vec{s}_k$ and $\\vec{y}_k$ is called the curvature condition. As it turns out, there's a fairly simple way to ensure this using the Wolfe condition from my previous article. Recall that during our line search, we required that\n$$\\begin{align}\\vec{p}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_{k+1} &amp;\\geq c_2(\\vec{p}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_k) \\\\ \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_{k+1} &amp;\\geq c_2(\\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_k) \\\\ \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} (\\vec{y}_k + \\vec{g}_{k}) &amp;\\geq c_2(\\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_k) \\\\ \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{y}_k + \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_{k} &amp;\\geq c_2(\\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_k) \\\\ \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{y}_k &amp;\\geq (c_2 - 1)(\\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{g}_k) \\\\ \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{y}_k &amp;\\geq (c_2 - 1)\\alpha_k \\vec{p}_k \\vec{g}_k \\end{align}$$\nSince we require $c_2 &gt; 1$ and $\\alpha_k &gt; 0$, and assuming $\\vec{p}_k$ is somewhat aligned with the gradient (or at a minimum, $\\vec{p}_k$ is pointing somewhere downhill), then the curvature condition clearly holds.\nUnfortunately, we're only a bit better off than we were when we had no idea what $B$ was. While these conditions limit the space of possible $B$ matrices, the set is still infinite. We need to find more ways to narrow down the space to a unique solution.\nOne way we could approach this is by assuming that $B$ shouldn't change too much at each update. There are a number of ways of going about this, but the basic idea is that we choose some norm on the change of the matrix between updates with different norms leading to different quasi-Newton algorithms. In particular, minimizing the Frobenius norm for this particular problem will give us the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) algorithm. It has a nice update step which we can apply to $B$ that looks like this:\n$$B_{k+1} = (I - \\rho_k \\vec{y}_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal}) B_k (I - \\rho_k \\vec{s}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal}) + \\rho_k \\vec{y}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal}$$\nwhere $\\rho_k = \\frac{1}{\\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{s}_k}$. However, we aren't actually done yet, since in the quasi-Newton update step, we really need the matrix $B_{k+1}^{-1}$. We could go and calculate a matrix inverse at each step, but it turns out we don't need to thanks to the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula, which says that the inverse of a rank-$k$ correction on a matrix is equivalent to a rank-$k$ correction on the inverse, or more precisely,\n$$(B + UCV)^{-1} = B^{-1} - B^{-1}U(C^{-1}+VB^{-1}U)^{-1}VB^{-1}$$\nwhere $B$ is $n\\times n$, $C$ is $k\\times k$, $U$ is $n\\times k$, and $V$ is $k\\times n$. This is a tough one, but we should take the time to work it out. First we expand the right side of the DFP formula:\n$$\nB_k - \\rho_k \\vec{y}_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} B_k - \\rho_k B_k \\vec{s}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal} + \\rho_k^2 \\vec{y}_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} B_k \\vec{s}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal} + \\rho_k \\vec{y}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal}\n$$\nEverything except for the very first $B_k$ should be thought of as those matrices $U$, $V$, and $C$. It is also helpful to know that by a rank-$k$ correction, we mean that the correction is written as $A' = A + \\vec{u}_1\\vec{v}_1^{\\intercal} + \\vec{u}_2\\vec{v}_2^{\\intercal} + ... + \\vec{u}_k\\vec{v}_k^{\\intercal}$. The two terms in the original DFP formula form such a correction of rank-2, since the first terms involve both $\\vec{y}_k$ and $\\vec{s}_k$ scaled by $\\rho_k$ and $B_k$ while the second term only involves $\\vec{y}_k$ scaled by $\\rho_k$, making it linearly independent. We then require $C$ to be a $2\\times 2$ matrix, $U$ to be $n\\times 2$, and $V$ to be $2\\times n$, where $n$ is the dimensionality of the Hessian. It's a bit tricky to see, but we can write this all in the form:2\n$$\nB_{k+1} = B_k + \\begin{bmatrix}\\rho_k\\vec{y}_k &amp; \\rho_k B_k\\vec{s}_k \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1 + \\rho_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} B_k \\vec{s}_k &amp; -1 \\\\ -1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\vec{y}_k \\\\ \\vec{s}_k B_k \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nI'll leave the actual application of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula as an exercise to the reader, but the conclusion is this rather nice looking update step for the inverse of the (approximate) Hessian:\n$$\nB_{k+1}^{-1} = B_k^{-1} - \\frac{B_k^{-1} \\vec{y}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal} B_k^{-1}}{\\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal} B_k^{-1} \\vec{y}_k} + \\frac{\\vec{s}_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal}}{\\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal} \\vec{s}_k}\n$$\nAt this point, we should be pretty happy. Given some starting value for the inverse Hessian, we have a way of determining a new inverse Hessian at our next step given the value of the old one! We could go and write this up, but then this article would need a different title. It just so happens that you can apply this very same process, but swap out $B$ for $B^{-1}$ at every step (with a new secant condition, $ B_{k+1}^{-1}\\vec{y}_k = \\vec{s}_k $) and skip that last bit entirely, and it works better in practice! In other words, the update step,\n$$ B_{k+1}^{-1} = (I - \\rho_k \\vec{s}_k \\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal})B_{k+1}^{-1} (I - \\rho_k \\vec{y}_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal}) + \\rho_k \\vec{s}_k \\vec{s}_k^{\\intercal} $$\nis also a unique solution to our quasi-Newton problem. This is the BFGS update. Of course, we still have the problem of what values should be assigned to $B_0^{-1}$. The neat part about BFGS is that this update step tends to be self-correcting (DFP is generally worse in this regard), assuming the Wolfe condition is met in the line search (this is why I spent so much time on the line search part of the previous post, it really is that important to make educated leaps in the gradient direction!). What this means is that even if we start with a bad initial guess at $B_0^{-1}$, after some number of steps, we should get to a good approximation regardless. We could of course just start with the numerically calculated Hessian, invert it, and go from there, but in practice, this really isn't worth the effort. Instead, we can just use the identity matrix3 for the very first step (just regular gradient descent!) and then correct that identity matrix each time. We will later find that this isn't even the most efficient way of doing things when we look at L-BFGS, but for now we have a formula, let's implement it!\nLet's start with a struct to hold our new algorithm:\n\nNext, our update formula:\n\nI've modified the Algorithm trait since making the previous post:\n\nWe now just pass the Minimizer's Status in as a mutable reference and ask the Algorithm to modify it accordingly. The implementation of the BFGS Algorithm is simply:\n\nThat's pretty much it. Of course, we need to add a few details to tell the algorithm where to stop. Some standard criteria are when the absolute change in the function value or the norm of the gradient goes below some tolerance, and you can see those termination conditions implemented in the full code here.\n\nI have to apologize a bit for the amount of changes in the code that have taken place since the last article. I'm developing this in conjunction with a library I'm currently using for amplitude analysis of particle physics data, and being relatively new to Rust, I often find improvements by realizing that I've backed myself into an implementation corner. I hope this article serves as a nice introduction to the BFGS algorithm and how one might implement it in Rust, but it is likely not the best way to implement this or the other algorithms I've discussed. If any readers see places where my code could be improved, I would welcome suggestions via the GitHub repo.\n\nWith that, I'll end this portion of the series. In the next post, I'll discuss the L-BFGS algorithm, the \"limited memory\" version of BFGS. The surprising thing we will see is that this method tends to work better than BFGS in most practical settings, and its close, bounded cousin, L-BFGS-B also tends to outperform standard BFGS updates. This is mostly because these methods not only reduce the memory required to perform BFGS updates (for large parameter spaces), they tend to involve fewer operations, which makes them more efficient to calculate. The core idea will be, rather than update and store the entire inverse Hessian, just store the changes and update an identity matrix, and while we're at it, just calculate the update step directly from the stored changes to the gradient!\n1\nThis notation is somewhat standard, but if you spend any time reading old papers on this, you'll find that they tend to use $B$, $H$, and their inverses rather interchangeably. For the sake of clarity, $H$ here will always refer to the true Hessian and $B$ to some approximated Hessian.\n\n2\nCredit due to A.Γ. in this post on the Mathematics StackExchange\n\n3\nWhile this would work, it's recommended to actually use $\\frac{\\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal}\\vec{s}_k}{\\vec{y}_k^{\\intercal}\\vec{y}_k}$ for the very first step, after the step has been made but before the first update is performed, and this is reflected in the code.\n\n","id":"https://denehoffman.com/blog/the-bfgs-algorithm-family-in-rust-part-2/","title":"The BFGS Algorithm Family in Rust (Part 2)"},"https://denehoffman.com/cv/":{"body":"\n    \n        🚧 Under Construction 🚧\n    \n    \n        I'm busy writing my thesis, but I'll have this done when I get some time.

It is intended to be a simple and efficient alternative to some of the other tools out there. laddu is written in Rust with bindings to Python via PyO3 and maturin and is the spiritual successor to rustitude, one of my first Rust projects. The goal of this project is to allow users to perform complex amplitude analyses (like partial-wave analyses) without complex code or configuration files.\nladdu grew out of my frustration with the way amplitude analyses were being done within the GlueX collaboration. Everyone had these messy configuration files which would need to be duplicated and modified, usually by one-off scripts, to produce fit results which would then have to be collected by yet another set of scripts. I got tired of the constant file management, I was spending more time debugging config files than actually doing physics! Since my original foray into Rust in March 2024, I have learned a lot about what is required to distribute a project like this via Python. There are tons of small optimizations that can be made, and I'd imagine there are still quite a few to go. This project has taught me everything from memory management to the intricacies of floating-point numbers to quite a lot about parallel processing. I believe the project is still in an exploratory state, but it is certainly usable enough to do some actual research now. Since I'm actively using it while I develop it, I quickly discover new sharp corners and quality-of-life features to implement, and there's always little chores to do like documentation and testing.\n\nganesh (/ɡəˈneɪʃ/), named after the Hindu god of wisdom, provides several common minimization algorithms as well as a straightforward, trait-based interface to create your own extensions. This crate is intended to be as simple as possible. The user needs to implement the Function trait on some struct which will take a vector of parameters and return a single-valued Result ($f(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\to\\mathbb{R}$). Users can optionally provide a gradient function to speed up some algorithms, but a default central finite-difference implementation is provided so that all algorithms will work out of the box.\nPart of the difficulty of this project is the lack of well-documented implementations of some of the more useful algorithms, like the BFGS family. While I am not sure, I believe this might be the first pure Rust implementation of L-BFGS-B. If you look through other optimization crates, Python packages, or even C/C++ libraries, a common theme you'll find is that they mostly just bind the original FORTRAN code written for this algorithm. I wanted to write the algorithm from scratch for two reasons. First, it's a great way to learn the language, and it's very convenient to not have to worry about dependencies in external languages like FORTRAN. Second, I had a lot of trouble finding bounded optimizers for Rust. argmin, the most-downloaded optimization crate, currently doesn't implement any constrained optimizers, although external solvers like egobox and cobyla can be used to accomplish this. nlopt has a Rust wrapper that includes these algorithms (written in C), but I quit using it after one too many C-related exceptions that were all-but-impossible to track down or solve with Rust code.\n\nrustitude is intended to be a one-stop-shop for amplitude analysis. At GlueX, we typically rely on AmpTools or PyPWA for performing partial-wave analyses (PWAs), moment analyses, and the like. These each come with pros and cons. For AmpTools, the major pros are that its fast (C++), can use MPI and run on GPUs, and has an assortment of pre-written amplitudes that allow users to just start writing analysis code. The major con, in my opinion, is that you typically don't write C++ to use AmpTools, you instead write a config file with a completely new syntax. In practice, since these config files aren't code, you end up writing quite a few of them for very similar purposes. Since it isn't code, it's very prone to typos which won't be detected till runtime and you can accidentally overwrite things by including other configs within configs. Furthermore, the output file must then be read by some custom C++ code that will typically vary for each kind of fit you might do. I usually see people write C++ code to put the fit results in a format that is easier to read in Python or messy ROOT code to directly make histograms. On the other hand PyPWA, as the name suggests, is written in Python, so it's already leagues slower than AmpTools, despite optimizations that can be made with JIT compilers like numba. The pros here are that Python is a very simple language which can be used to quickly prototype and test new code and easily visualize the results. You can even run it interactively! However, the documentation is a bit lacking, the implementation of amplitudes is not straightforward, and it hasn't been updated in over a year.\nThese are mostly minor annoyances. AmpTools works great, and I've used it for my own thesis work, but I've always wanted to try my hand at writing something to do the task in a different way. rustitude is the first iteration of this, and was my first project using Rust with PyO3 bindings to Python. I knew at the outset I wanted the primary interface for users to be Python, but for speed purposes there needed to be a compiled backend. I began the project with a few other goals, the first of which was to make it extremely simple to write new amplitudes without knowing much Rust. Next, I wanted the framework to precalculate and cache as much as possible ahead of time. For example, there are a couple of AmpTools amplitudes which are based on spherical harmonics. For every spherical harmonic, the spherical angles are generally going to depend on data from the events and not from any free parameters in a model, so it really isn't necessary to calculate them every time the main function is evaluated. AmpTools does some caching, but because it can only do it on a per-amplitude basis (you can't cache different values for a $Y_{00}$ and a $Y_{10}$ amplitude without writing separate amplitude files for each, for instance), there is still a lot of room for optimization.\nThis project is currently operational and accomplishes most of these goals to my satisfaction. However, it is still a bit slower than I'd like and very memory-hungry. AmpTools uses a lot of nice pointer manipulation, and MPI allows the calculation to be divided across multiple nodes of an HPC cluster, which also spreads out the memory usage. In rustitude, ROOT files are primarily read into memory in their entirety, and calculations are limited to one node (although multiprocessing is set up to efficiently use as many cores as desired). There are also some ergonomics that I'm not happy about, and if you look in the git history, you can see that it went through several rewrites before getting to this form. I used this project to learn Rust, and now that I understand it a bit more, there are a lot of things that will be difficult to improve without major refactors. I've since started working on a successor project (see laddu above) that will hopefully address these issues.\n","id":"https://denehoffman.com/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://denehoffman.com/publications/":{"body":"2022\n\nFano Resonant Optical coatings platform for Full Gamut and High Purity Structural Colors\nChunlei Guo, Mohamed ElKabbash, Nathaniel Hoffman, Andrew Lininger, Sohail Jalil, Theodore Letsou, Michael Hinczewski, Giuseppe Strangi\n\n    \n        Structural coloring is a photostable and environmentally friendly coloring approach...\n        \n        Read More\n        \n    \n    \n        Structural coloring is a photostable and environmentally friendly coloring approach that harnesses optical interference and Nanophotonic resonances to obtain colors with a range of applications including display technologies, colorful solar panels, steganography, décor, data storage, and anticounterfeiting measures.

We show that an additional oxide film deposited on Fano resonant optical coatings (FROCs) increases the color purity (up to 97%) and color gamut coverage range (&gt; 99% coverage of the sRGB and Adobe color spaces).

Although the single site occupation is random, chemical interaction preferences bias the occupation probabilities of neighboring sites, and this bias reduced the entropy of mixing below its ideal value. Sufficiently strong bias leads to symmetry-breaking phase transitions. We apply the cluster variation method to explore solid solutions on body centered cubic lattices in the context of two specific compounds that exhibit opposite ordering trends. Employing density functional theory to model the energetics, we show that CuZn exhibits an order-disorder transition to the CsCl prototype structure, while AlLi instead takes the NaTl prototype structure, and we evaluate their temperature-dependent order parameters, correlations and entropies.\n        \n        Read Less\n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\narXiv:2007.13219\n\nFano-resonant ultrathin film optical coatings\nMohamed ElKabbash, Theodore Letsou, Sohail A Jalil, Nathaniel Hoffman, Jihua Zhang, James Rutledge, Andrew R Lininger, Chun-Hao Fann, Michael Hinczewski, Giuseppe Strangi, Chunlei Guo\n\n    \n        Optical coatings are integral components of virtually every optical instrument...\n        \n        Read More\n        \n    \n    \n        Optical coatings are integral components of virtually every optical instrument. However, despite being a century-old technology, there are only a handful of optical coating types. Here, we introduce a type of optical coatings that exhibit photonic Fano resonance, or a Fano-resonant optical coating (FROC). We expand the coupled mechanical oscillator description of Fano resonance to thin-film nanocavities. Using FROCs with thicknesses in the order of 300 nm, we experimentally obtained narrowband reflection akin to low-index-contrast dielectric Bragg mirrors and achieved control over the reflection iridescence. We observed that semi-transparent FROCs can transmit and reflect the same colour as a beam splitter filter, a property that cannot be realized through conventional optical coatings. Finally, FROCs can spectrally and spatially separate the thermal and photovoltaic bands of the solar spectrum, presenting a possible solution to the dispatchability problem in photovoltaics, that is, the inability to dispatch solar energy on demand. Our solar thermal device exhibited power generation of up to 50% and low photovoltaic cell temperatures (~30 °C), which could lead to a six-fold increase in the photovoltaic cell lifetime.\n        \n        Read Less\n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nUltrathin-film optical coating for angle-independent remote hydrogen sensing\nMohamed ElKabbash, Kandammathe Valiyaveedu Sreekanth, Arwa Fraiwan, Jonathan Cole, Yunus Alapan, Theodore Letsou, Nathaniel Hoffman, Chunlei Guo, R Mohan Sankaran, Umut A Gurkan, Michael Hinczewski, Giuseppe Strangi\n\n    \n        We demonstrated an optically-active antireflection, light absorbing, optical coating as a hydrogen gas sensor...\n        \n        Read More\n        \n    \n    \n        We demonstrated an optically-active antireflection, light absorbing, optical coating as a hydrogen gas sensor. The optical coating consists of an ultrathin 20 nm thick palladium film on a 60 nm thick germanium layer. The ultrathin thickness of the Pd film (20 nm) mitigates mechanical deformation and leads to robust operation. The measurable quantities of the sensors are the shift in the reflection minimum and the change in the full width at half maximum of the reflection spectrum as a function of hydrogen gas concentration. At a hydrogen gas concentration of 4%, the reflection minimum shifted by ∼46 nm and the FWHM increased by ∼228 nm. The sensor showed excellent sensitivity, demonstrating a 6.5 nm wavelength shift for 0.7% hydrogen concentration, which is a significant improvement over other nanophotonic hydrogen sensing methods. Although the sensor's response showed hysteresis after cycling hydrogen exposure, the sensor is robust and showed no deterioration in its optical response after hydrogen deintercalation.\n        \n        Read Less\n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nTunable black gold: controlling the near‐field coupling of immobilized au nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous silica capsules\nMohamed ElKabbash, Ana Sousa‐Castillo, Quang Nguyen, Rosalia Mariño‐Fernández, Nathaniel Hoffman, Miguel A Correa‐Duarte, Giuseppe Strangi\n\n    \n        Efficient light-to-heat conversion is central for various applications such as thermo-photovoltaics and solar steam generation...\n        \n        Read More\n        \n    \n    \n        Efficient light-to-heat conversion is central for various applications such as thermo-photovoltaics and solar steam generation. Although metals can strongly absorb light and generate heat, their free electrons shield the electric field before any substantial penetration in the metal. Excitation of surface plasmons can suppress metal reflection and convert it into a black metal, for example, black gold. In this work, mesoporous silica capsules grafted with immobilized Au nanoparticles (NPs) with different sizes via controlled chemical synthesis are synthesized. It is shown that changing the size of immobilized NPs modifies the interparticle coupling strength, thus, modifying the NPs absorption. The broadness of the plasmon resonance is tuned across the visible, near-infrared, and short wavelength infrared regions. The ability to control the broadness of black gold absorption is not possible in other systems based on bottom-up synthesis. The proposed approach broadens the possibilities of utilizing black gold in many applications such as thermo-photovoltaics, and solar energy harvesting especially in hybrid solar converters.\n        \n        Read Less\n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\nIridescence-free and narrowband perfect light absorption in critically coupled metal high-index dielectric cavities\nM ElKabbash, E Ilker, T Letsou, N Hoffman, A Yaney, M Hinczewski, G Strangi\n\n    \n        Perfect light absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) was demonstrated using metamaterials, plasmonic nanostructures, and thin films...\n        \n        Read More\n        \n    \n    \n        Perfect light absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) was demonstrated using metamaterials, plasmonic nanostructures, and thin films. Thin film absorbers offer a simple and low-cost design as they can be produced on large areas and without lithography. Light is strongly absorbed in thin film metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) cavities at their resonance frequencies. However, a major drawback of MDM absorbers is their strong resonance iridescence, i.e., angle dependence. Here, we solve the iridescence problem by achieving angle-insensitive narrowband perfect and near-perfect light absorption. In particular, we show analytically that using a high-index dielectric in MDM cavities is sufficient to achieve angle-insensitive cavity resonance. We demonstrate experimentally angle-insensitive perfect and near-perfect absorbers in the NIR and visible regimes up to ±60°. By overcoming the iridescence problem, we open the door for practical applications of MDM absorbers at optical frequencies.\n        \n        Read Less\n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n","id":"https://denehoffman.com/publications/","title":"Publications"}},"docInfo":{"https://denehoffman.com/":{"body":212,"title":0},"https://denehoffman.com/blog/":{"body":8,"title":2},"https://denehoffman.com/blog/the-bfgs-algorithm-family-in-rust-part-1/":{"body":1358,"title":6},"https://denehoffman.com/blog/the-bfgs-algorithm-family-in-rust-part-2/":{"body":1455,"title":6},"https://denehoffman.com/cv/":{"body":13,"title":1},"https://denehoffman.com/projects/":{"body":680,"title":1},"https://denehoffman.com/publications/":{"body":865,"title":1}},"length":7},"lang":"English"}
